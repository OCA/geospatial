GeoEngine is an Odoo module that adds spatial/GIS capabilites to Odoo. It will allow you to :

* Visualize and query your business information on map
* Perform GeoBI and spatial query
* Configure your spatial layers and spatial datasources
* Extend Odoo models with spatial columns

GeoEngine relies on `OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org>`_ and `PostgGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/>`_ technologies.

Postgis is used to store spatial information in databases. OpenLayer is used to represent spatial data in other words to show maps
and the different spatial layers. The GeoEngine module acts as a data provider and as an OpenLayers configurator.
It also provides a complete extension to Odoo ORM.
