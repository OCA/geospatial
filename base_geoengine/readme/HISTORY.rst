16.0.1.0.0 (2023-03-20)
========================

* LayerSwitcher has been removed as it was not really practical. A LayerPanel is now active.
* The geo_search method is now deprecated and replaced by the standard odoo search method.
* The widget "geo_edit_map" attribute is no longer necessary as the field is automatically detected by
  his type. We can also provide an option attribute that allows us to pass an opacity and a color as
  parameters.

.. code-block:: xml

    <form>
        <notebook colspan="4">
            <page string="Geometry">
                <field name="the_geom" options="{'opacity': 0.8, 'color': '#0000FF' }" />
            </page>
        </notebook>
    </form>

* The method geo_search is now deprecated. We now need to use the standard odoo search method.

.. code-block:: python

    obj.search([("the_point","geo_intersect",{"dummy.zip.the_geom": [("id", "=", rec.id)]})])

* We can now pass to the geoengine view a template to display the information we want
  to see when clicking on a feature.

.. code-block:: xml

    <geoengine>
        <field name="name" />
        <field name="city" />
        <field name="total_sales" />
        <field name="the_geom" />
        <templates>
            <t t-name="info_box">
                <field name="city" widget="badge" />
                <ul>
                    <li>ZIP : <field name="name" />
                    </li>
                    <li>Total Sales: <field name="total_sales" />
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </t>
        </templates>
    </geoengine>

* We can now pass a model to use to a layer to display other information on the map.

.. code-block:: xml

    <record id="geoengine_vector_layer_hs_retail_machines" model="geoengine.vector.layer">
        <field name="model_id" ref="base_geoengine_demo.model_geoengine_demo_automatic_retailing_machine"/>
        <field name="model_domain">[('state', '=', 'hs')]</field>
        <field name="geo_field_id" ref="base_geoengine_demo.field_geoengine_demo_automatic_retailing_machine__the_point"/>
        <field name="name">HS retail machines</field>
        <field name="view_id" ref="ir_ui_view_resbetterzipgeoview0" />
        <field name="geo_repr">basic</field>
        <field name="attribute_field_id" ref="base_geoengine_demo.field_geoengine_demo_automatic_retailing_machine__name"/>
        <field name="begin_color">#FF0000</field>
        <field name="display_polygon_labels" eval="0" />
        <field name="layer_opacity">0.8</field>
    </record>


* There is some new features in the LayerPanel.

1. If you are logged in as an admin, you have the possibility to edit the layer by clicking on the edit button. This will open a dialog box.
   Changes will appear in real time on the view.
2. If you are logged in as an admin, you can also change the domain of the layer. If you are logged in as a user, changes will not be
   persisted in the database. Changes will appear in real time on the view.
3. If you are logged in as an admin, you can also change the sequence of the layers by sliding them over each other. If you are logged in as a user, changes will not be
   persisted in the database.

* Widget domain is now implemented for geo field This means that the geo-operators are also implemented and that there is the possibility to add a sub-domain.
  If we want to add a domain that includes all the records that are displayed in the geoengine view (active_ids). We can use the two new operators :
  "in active_ids" and "not in active_ids". These will automatically replace the marker with ids. Note that the widget will indicate that the domain is invalid
  because of the marker.
* Creation of the RecordsPanel. This panel allows you to retrieve all active records. You can click on record to get the movement to the selected record.
  Two magnifying glass are also available. You can click on the left one to zoom on the record. You can click on the right one to get the original zoom.
* A search bar is also available. It allows you to perform a search into the RecordsPanel.
* A button to open/close the panels is also available.
* The module has been translated in French.
* Now you can now make the geoengine view editable. Simply add editable attribute in the geoengine view.

.. code-block:: xml

    <geoengine editable="1">
        <field name="name" />
        <field name="city" />
        <field name="total_sales" />
        <field name="the_geom" />
        <field name="display_name" />
        <templates>
          <t t-name="info_box">
            <field name="city" widget="badge" />
            <ul>
              <li>ZIP : <field name="name" />
              </li>
              <li>Total Sales: <field name="total_sales" />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </t>
        </templates>
      </geoengine>

    Thanks to that, you can create new records by drawing them directly in the geoengine view. You can also edit record in the same view.
