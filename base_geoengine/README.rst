===========================

Geospatial support based on PostGIS add the ability of server to server
geojson to do geo CRUD and view definition.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to have `PostGIS <http://postgis.net/>`_ installed.

On Ubuntu::

  sudo apt-get install postgis

The module also requires two additional python libs:

* `Shapely <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`_

* `geojson <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson>`_

for a complete documentation please refer to the `public documenation <http://oca.github.io/geospatial/index.html>`_

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

 * Google layers have been removed as it was not working anyway.
 * Switching from map to form view should be eased to open selected feature.
   It should work using `do_switch_view` and this probably requires to set `self.dataset.index`
 * A good way to open a record from map should be done with double click.
   However selection handlers have difficulties to work nice with click events.
