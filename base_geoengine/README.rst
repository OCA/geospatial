GeoEngine is an Odoo module that adds spatial/GIS capabilites to Odoo. It will allow you to :

* Visualize and query your business information on map
* Perform GeoBI and spatial query
* Configure your spatial layers and spatial datasources
* Extend Odoo models with spatial columns

GeoEngine relies on `OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org>`_ and `PostgGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/>`_ technologies.

Postgis is used to store spatial information in databases. OpenLayer is used to represent spatial data in other words to show maps
and the different spatial layers. The GeoEngine module acts as a data provider and as an OpenLayers configurator.
It also provides a complete extension to Odoo ORM.

Installation
============


To install this module, you need to have `PostGIS <http://postgis.net/>`_ installed.

On Ubuntu::

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt-get install postgis

The module also requires two additional python libs:

* `Shapely <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`_

* `geojson <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson>`_

When you will install the module this two additional libs will be installed.

For a complete documentation please refer to the `public documenation <http://oca.github.io/geospatial/index.html>`_

Usage
=====

Geoengine Demo
==============

1. As a user/admin, when I am in the Geoengine Demo module and I go to the ZIP menu.
   When I click on an item in the list view, I get to the form view showing me the different
   information about the ZIP. We can see its ZIP, city, priority, total sales and his spatial
   representation.
2. As a user, I can't modify the information in the form view.
3. As an admin, I can modify the information in the form view. I can click on the bin button to clear
   the map and I can draw a new shape.
4. As a user, when I go the "Retail machines" tab and there are no items to display, it does not
   show me anything.
5. As an admin, when I go the "Retail machines" tab and there are no items to display, the list view of
   the retail machines suggests to me to add a new line.
6. As a user/admin, if there are items to be displayed in the "Retail machines" tab then I can click on an
   item and the retail machines form view will be displayed. We can see its spatial representation by going
   to "The point" tab and its attributes in "Attributes" tab.
7. As a user/admin, when I go to the geoengine zip view by clicking on the map button at the top right of the
   screen. The geoengine view appears with the first 80 results displayed on the map. The vector layers
   selected are those defined as "active on startup" by the admin. The selected raster layer is the first
   one that is not an overlay layer.
8. As a user/admin, when I hover over an area on the map, the area changes its style.
9. As a user/admin, when I click on an area, a popup appears an I can see the different information about the
   area. If I click on the cross, the popup will disappear. If I click somewhere else on the map, the
   popup will also disappear. If I click on the about button, then the form view will be displayed.
10. As a user/admin, when I use the paging system, then the results displayed on the map are different
    (corresponding to the request).
11. As a user/admin, if we use the search bar, we can search results by his zip or his city.
12. As an admin, if I change the sequence of layers with the handle button then the change are persisted in database.
13. As a user, if I change the sequence of layers with the handle button then the change are not persisted in database.
    There are just the changes in the display.
14. As an admin, if I change the domain of a layer with the filter button then the change are persisted in database.
15. As a user, if I change the domain of a layer with the filter button then the change are not persisted in database.
    There are just the changes in the display.
16. As an admin, I have the possibility to edit the layer with its corresponding button.
17. As a user/admin, I can open/close LayerPanel with its button.
18. As a user/admin, I can open/close RecordsPanel with its button.
19. As a user/admin, when I click on a record in RecordsPanel, a move is made on the map to the selected record.
20. As a user/admin, when I click on a record in RecordsPanel, I can also click on the left magnifying glass to zoom on the record.
21. As a user/admin, when I click on a record in RecordsPanel, I can also click on the right magnifying glass to get the original zoom.
22. As a user/admin, I can use the search bar to search in the RecordsPanel.
23. As an admin,If the geoengine view is in edit mode, I can create new records by drawing them in the view.
24. As an admin, If the geoengine view is in edit mode, I can modify its spatial representation.

Geoengine Backend
=================

1. As an admin, if I go into the configuration of the raster layers and it has elements, I can click
   on one and see its information.
2. As an admin, if I want to create a new raster layer, I can click on "NEW" and fill out the form. The
   required fields for OpenStreetMap type are "Layer Name" and "Related View". If we want to have a
   WMTS (Web Map Tile Service) raster type. The required fields in addition to the precedents are "Service URL",
   "Matrix set","Format", "Projection" and "Resolutions". If we take WMS (Web Map Service) raster type, then the
   required fields are "Layer Name", "Related View", "Service URL", "Params", "Server Type".
3. As an admin,if I go into the configuration of the vector layers and it has elements, I can click
   on one and see its information.
4. As an admin, if I want to create a new vector layer, I can click on "NEW" and fill out the form. The
   required fields are "Layer Name", "Related View", "Geo field" and "Representation mode".

Changelog
=========

16.0.1.0.0 (2023-03-20)
========================

* LayerSwitcher has been removed as it was not really practical. A LayerPanel is now active.
* The geo_search method is now deprecated and replaced by the standard odoo search method.
* The widget "geo_edit_map" attribute is no longer necessary as the field is automatically detected by
  his type. We can also provide an option attribute that allows us to pass an opacity and a color as
  parameters.

.. code-block:: xml

    <form>
        <notebook colspan="4">
            <page string="Geometry">
                <field name="the_geom" options="{'opacity': 0.8, 'color': '#0000FF' }" />
            </page>
        </notebook>
    </form>

* The method geo_search is now deprecated. We now need to use the standard odoo search method.

.. code-block:: python

    obj.search([("the_point","geo_intersect",{"dummy.zip.the_geom": [("id", "=", rec.id)]})])

* We can now pass to the geoengine view a template to display the information we want
  to see when clicking on a feature.

.. code-block:: xml

    <geoengine>
        <field name="name" />
        <field name="city" />
        <field name="total_sales" />
        <field name="the_geom" />
        <templates>
            <t t-name="info_box">
                <field name="city" widget="badge" />
                <ul>
                    <li>ZIP : <field name="name" />
                    </li>
                    <li>Total Sales: <field name="total_sales" />
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </t>
        </templates>
    </geoengine>

* We can now pass a model to use to a layer to display other information on the map.

.. code-block:: xml

    <record id="geoengine_vector_layer_hs_retail_machines" model="geoengine.vector.layer">
        <field name="model_id" ref="base_geoengine_demo.model_geoengine_demo_automatic_retailing_machine"/>
        <field name="model_domain">[('state', '=', 'hs')]</field>
        <field name="geo_field_id" ref="base_geoengine_demo.field_geoengine_demo_automatic_retailing_machine__the_point"/>
        <field name="name">HS retail machines</field>
        <field name="view_id" ref="ir_ui_view_resbetterzipgeoview0" />
        <field name="geo_repr">basic</field>
        <field name="attribute_field_id" ref="base_geoengine_demo.field_geoengine_demo_automatic_retailing_machine__name"/>
        <field name="begin_color">#FF0000</field>
        <field name="display_polygon_labels" eval="0" />
        <field name="layer_opacity">0.8</field>
    </record>


* There is some new features in the LayerPanel.

1. If you are logged in as an admin, you have the possibility to edit the layer by clicking on the edit button. This will open a dialog box.
   Changes will appear in real time on the view.
2. If you are logged in as an admin, you can also change the domain of the layer. If you are logged in as a user, changes will not be
   persisted in the database. Changes will appear in real time on the view.
3. If you are logged in as an admin, you can also change the sequence of the layers by sliding them over each other. If you are logged in as a user, changes will not be
   persisted in the database.

* Widget domain is now implemented for geo field This means that the geo-operators are also implemented and that there is the possibility to add a sub-domain.
  If we want to add a domain that includes all the records that are displayed in the geoengine view (active_ids). We can use the two new operators :
  "in active_ids" and "not in active_ids". These will automatically replace the marker with ids. Note that the widget will indicate that the domain is invalid
  because of the marker.
* Creation of the RecordsPanel. This panel allows you to retrieve all active records. You can click on record to get the movement to the selected record.
  Two magnifying glass are also available. You can click on the left one to zoom on the record. You can click on the right one to get the original zoom.
* A search bar is also available. It allows you to perform a search into the RecordsPanel.
* A button to open/close the panels is also available.
* The module has been translated in French.
* Now you can now make the geoengine view editable. Simply add editable attribute in the geoengine view.

.. code-block:: xml

    <geoengine editable="1">
        <field name="name" />
        <field name="city" />
        <field name="total_sales" />
        <field name="the_geom" />
        <field name="display_name" />
        <templates>
          <t t-name="info_box">
            <field name="city" widget="badge" />
            <ul>
              <li>ZIP : <field name="name" />
              </li>
              <li>Total Sales: <field name="total_sales" />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </t>
        </templates>
      </geoengine>

    Thanks to that, you can create new records by drawing them directly in the geoengine view. You can also edit record in the same view.
