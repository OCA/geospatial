ORTools offers many additional options for solving routes. For instance,
this module could be improved in the following ways:

* Set both start and end points, not just a depot (same start/end)
* Allow solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (more than 1 route/vehicle)
* Allow solving for capacity constraints (carrying capacity of each vehicle)
* Allow solving with time window constraints
